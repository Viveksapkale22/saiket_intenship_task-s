# saiket_intenship_task-s
this is the virtual internship about data science, goes for the 1 month .  I completed the 6 tasks in the 4 week which help me to enhance my skill in ML, python, data science .

Project Title: Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

Project Overview:
The project aims to analyze customer churn in a
telecommunications company and develop
predictive models to identify at-risk customers. The
ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights and
recommendations to reduce churn and improve
customer retention.

📌 Task Details

🔹 Task 1: Data Preparation

Objective:
Prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.

Work Done:

Loaded the telecom customer dataset

Performed initial data exploration

Handled missing values and inconsistencies

Encoded categorical variables into numerical form

Split data into training and testing sets

Outcome:
A clean, structured dataset ready for analysis and machine learning.

🔹 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective:
Understand customer behavior and identify churn patterns.

Work Done:

Calculated overall customer churn rate

Analyzed churn distribution by:

Gender

Partner and dependent status

Studied tenure distribution and its relation to churn

Examined churn trends across:

Contract types

Payment methods

Key Insights:

Customers on month-to-month contracts showed higher churn

Short-tenure customers were more likely to churn

Contract type and payment method strongly influenced churn behavior

🔹 Task 3: Customer Segmentation

Objective:
Identify high-risk and high-value customer segments.

Work Done:

Segmented customers based on:

Tenure

Monthly charges

Contract type

Analyzed churn rates within each segment

Identified high-value customers at risk of churn

Outcome:
Clear identification of customer groups requiring targeted retention strategies.

🔹 Task 4 & 5: Churn Prediction, Model Evaluation & Interpretation

Objective:
Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn.

Work Done:

Implemented predictive models such as:

Logistic Regression

Trained and tested models using:

Accuracy : 0.8071090047393364

Precision : 0.6590909090909091

Recall : 0.8110516934046346  {after the hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV}

F1-score : 0.610526315789473

Evaluated model performance using:

ROC Curve

AUC score : 0.838

Interpreted feature importance to understand churn drivers

Key Findings:

Logistic Regression provided stable and interpretable results

Important churn factors included:

Contract type

Tenure

Monthly charges

ROC–AUC analysis confirmed model reliability

📈 Final Results & Key Outcomes

Successfully analyzed customer churn patterns across multiple dimensions

Identified high-risk customer segments prone to churn

Built predictive machine learning models for churn detection

Interpreted model results to extract business-relevant insights

Provided a data-driven foundation for improving customer retention strategies

📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this internship, I gained hands-on experience in:

Real-world data preprocessing and analysis

Exploratory data analysis and visualization

Customer segmentation techniques

Machine learning model building and evaluation

Translating data insights into business recommendations
